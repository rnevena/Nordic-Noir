						<h1>pusher</h1>
						<p>Pusher is a Danish crime film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. In 1996, a Danish crime film was quite novel, and its popularity had a great influence on Danish films to follow. Each sequel follows a different character introduced in the first film. The first film follows Frank, a Copenhagen drug dealer. After a drug deal gone bad, Frank finds himself deeply in debt to Milo, a local Serbian drug lord. As Frank struggles to find the money, he must also grapple with complications from his would-be girlfriend and the dubious loyalty of his partner, Tonny. The second film picks up with Tonny after he completes a prison sentence and returns to his estranged father's chop shop. Tonny struggles to earn his father's respect in the underworld and be there for his own son. The third film follows a day in the life of Milo, who struggles with preparations for his overbearing daughter's birthday while fending off Albanian drug dealers and his own lurking addiction.</p>
